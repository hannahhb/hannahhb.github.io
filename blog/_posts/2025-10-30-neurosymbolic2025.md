title: "Robustness of Neurosymbolic Reasoners on First-Order Logic Problems"

This post summarizes my research exploring **how neurosymbolic reasoners generalize and fail** under logical perturbations.

<!-- We categorize errors in JSONL-logged model outputs such as:
- Arity mismatches
- Unexpected tokens
- Malformed predicates

The pipeline quantifies **robustness drops** as logical noise increases, comparing pure symbolic solvers vs. hybrid LLM–FOL systems. -->
