# 👋 Hi, I’m Hannah Bansal  
I’m an Honours student in Computer Science at RMIT University, researching **robustness of neurosymbolic reasoners**, **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, and **knowledge-grounded LLMs**.  

I’m passionate about building interpretable, logically consistent AI systems that integrate symbolic reasoning with neural models.  

📍 Currently: CSIRO AEHRC · Melbourne, Australia
