# About Me

I’m an AI researcher exploring the intersection of **neurosymbolic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and biomedical NLP**.

My recent work includes:
- 🧩 Evaluating **LLM-integrated symbolic reasoners** on logical consistency and counterfactual robustness.
- 🧠 Participating in the **CURE-Bench** challenge for biomedical therapeutic reasoning.
- ⚛️ Developing quantum-enhanced algorithms for optimization and molecular simulation.

When not coding, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, and exploring ethical AI questions through the **CAIDE** community at the University of Melbourne.
